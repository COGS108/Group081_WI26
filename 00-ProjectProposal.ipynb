    "Team Expectation 2: Tone and Interpersonal Conduct\n",
    "At the first in-person meeting, the team will explicitly agree on communication tone and\n",
    "interpersonal norms. The agreed-upon standard will be respectful, blunt, and polite,\n",
    "recognizing that direct feedback is important for project success while maintaining\n",
    "professionalism. Personal insults, dismissive language, or hostile behavior will not be tolerated\n",

    "to express disagreement clearly and constructively, for example by explaining concerns with\n",
    "reasoning and inviting discussion. A core expectation is that all concerns—technical, logistical,\n",
    "or interpersonal—should be voiced openly without fear of judgment or shame. Silence due to\n",

    "communicate this early and openly, preferably through Discord. If Discord communication fails\n",
    "or is not acknowledged, email may be used as a secondary option. The team recognizes that\n",
    "members bring different strengths, particularly in data science and computer science, and will\n",
    "leverage prior experience to provide targeted support when needed.\n",
    "When assistance is required, effort will be reallocated collaboratively, ensuring that no single\n",

    "The team will follow an agile-style workflow, structured around two- to three-week sprints.\n",
    "Sprint length and scope will be adjusted depending on task complexity, dependencies, and\n",
    "project priorities. Goals, tasks, and deadlines will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect\n",
