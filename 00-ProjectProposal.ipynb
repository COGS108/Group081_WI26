    "Music has long served as a window into cultural links and emotional states. People’s choices in music reflect not only individual taste but also broader societal conditions, such as social environment and collective experience. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 brought unprecedented disruption to everyday life worldwide, prompting researchers to examine how such a global shock altered human behaviour — including music listening and creation — and whether these changes persisted beyond lockdowns into the post-COVID era. Studies show that during acute pandemic periods, listeners turned to music not just for entertainment, but as an emotional regulation strategy, with distinct preferences emerging for nostalgic and emotionally positive songs as a means of coping with stress and isolation.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Early empirical work on music consumption during the pandemic found that lockdowns significantly changed listening behaviour. For example, analysis of Last.fm users’ streaming records revealed reduced variety and novelty in music consumption during the initial shock of the pandemic, coupled with a greater preference for mainstream artists and familiar tracks, suggesting that uncertainty led listeners to gravitate toward familiar, comforting music.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Another investigation in the UK documented a surge in listening to older ‘nostalgic’ music during lockdown, particularly positive-toned songs, indicating that both nostalgia and emotional valence influenced choices during COVID-19.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond behavioural changes, researchers have also analysed the structure of musical content itself over time. Some studies have explored how measurable audio features — such as tempo, energy, danceability, and valence — relate to listening contexts or activities. One such study found that Spotify’s audio features like valence and energy are associated with listeners’ motivational contexts (e.g., dance, relaxation), suggesting that higher energy and valence are linked to more active listening situations.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Another data-driven project using Spotify’s API showed that tempo, energy, and valence are among the features most strongly correlated with track popularity across genres, forming a basis for linking audio characteristics with success metrics.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent longitudinal work has explicitly contextualized music trends across COVID and post-COVID periods. A comprehensive analysis of the top 1,000 Spotify songs from 2011 to 2023 reported significant shifts in dominant musical features over time, with pre-pandemic years showing rising trends in energy and loudness, and post-pandemic years characterized by increases in acoustic and introspective qualities.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) Though focusing broadly on feature evolution, such work underscores that major global events can coincide with measurable changes in the sonic qualities of popular music, supporting the idea that cultural and technological factors shape music trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other research frames these shifts within broader emotional and societal trends. For instance, sentiment analysis of popular music lyrics across the pre-, during-, and post-COVID periods found thematic changes reflecting anxiety and introspection during the pandemic — suggesting that external stressors are mirrored not only in listening behaviour, but in the creative output of music itself.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) Collectively, this prior work reveals that music both reflects and shapes human experience during major societal shocks, and that measurable audio features can serve as quantifiable indicators of broader shifts in cultural mood and preference. As such, your project — which investigates how genre popularity and audio characteristics changed in the post-COVID era — builds directly on these existing streams of research, extending them with a structured comparison of popularity dynamics and audio features over clearly defined time periods.\n",
