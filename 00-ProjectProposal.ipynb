    "Music has long served as a window into cultural links and emotional states. People’s choices in music reflect not only individual taste but also broader societal conditions, such as social environment and collective experience. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 brought unprecedented disruption to everyday life worldwide, prompting researchers to examine how such a global shock altered human behaviour — including music listening and creation — and whether these changes persisted beyond lockdowns into the post-COVID era. Studies show that during acute pandemic periods, listeners turned to music not just for entertainment, but as an emotional regulation strategy, with distinct preferences emerging for nostalgic and emotionally positive songs as a means of coping with stress and isolation.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Early empirical work on music consumption during the pandemic found that lockdowns significantly changed listening behaviour. For example, analysis of Last.fm users’ streaming records revealed reduced variety and novelty in music consumption during the initial shock of the pandemic, coupled with a greater preference for mainstream artists and familiar tracks, suggesting that uncertainty led listeners to gravitate toward familiar, comforting music.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Another investigation in the UK documented a surge in listening to older ‘nostalgic’ music during lockdown, particularly positive-toned songs, indicating that both nostalgia and emotional valence influenced choices during COVID-19.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond behavioural changes, researchers have also analysed the structure of musical content itself over time. Some studies have explored how measurable audio features — such as tempo, energy, danceability, and valence — relate to listening contexts or activities. One such study found that Spotify’s audio features like valence and energy are associated with listeners’ motivational contexts (e.g., dance, relaxation), suggesting that higher energy and valence are linked to more active listening situations.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Another data-driven project using Spotify’s API showed that tempo, energy, and valence are among the features most strongly correlated with track popularity across genres, forming a basis for linking audio characteristics with success metrics.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent longitudinal work has explicitly contextualized music trends across COVID and post-COVID periods. A comprehensive analysis of the top 1,000 Spotify songs from 2011 to 2023 reported significant shifts in dominant musical features over time, with pre-pandemic years showing rising trends in energy and loudness, and post-pandemic years characterized by increases in acoustic and introspective qualities.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) Though focusing broadly on feature evolution, such work underscores that major global events can coincide with measurable changes in the sonic qualities of popular music, supporting the idea that cultural and technological factors shape music trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other research frames these shifts within broader emotional and societal trends. For instance, sentiment analysis of popular music lyrics across the pre-, during-, and post-COVID periods found thematic changes reflecting anxiety and introspection during the pandemic — suggesting that external stressors are mirrored not only in listening behaviour, but in the creative output of music itself.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) Collectively, this prior work reveals that music both reflects and shapes human experience during major societal shocks, and that measurable audio features can serve as quantifiable indicators of broader shifts in cultural mood and preference. As such, your project — which investigates how genre popularity and audio characteristics changed in the post-COVID era — builds directly on these existing streams of research, extending them with a structured comparison of popularity dynamics and audio features over clearly defined time periods.\n",

    "    Ideal Dataset:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Ideal Variables for the dataset :\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time Variables such as year and period ( pre-Covid vs post-Covid )\n",
    "    Popularity Variables, number of streams per track, some kind of normalized popularity score, and a ranking either monthly or yearly.\n",
    "    Genre Variables, artist genre classification, primary and or sub genre.\n",
    "    Audio Characteristics like tempo, danceability, loudness, and energy.\n",
    "    Identification, some sort of song ID along with an artist ID and their available platforms \n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Number of observations needed : \n",
    "\n",
    "    An ideal range would be between 40,000 to 100,000 tracks, this ensures that we have an ample amount of tracks per year with different genres along with reducing biased for songs that \n",
    "    went viral for a short period of time. A larger number of tracks in theory would result in a more stable average for genre and their audio features. \n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Who/What/How data would be collected : \n",
    "\n",
    "    Who: Large music platforms ( Spotify, Apple Music, etc. ) \n",
    "    What: Music that was popular and or charted between 2017-2019 and 2020 - 2024\n",
    "    How: API data collection, Publicly Listed Charts, or pre-existing datasets ( Kaggle )\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. How would this data be stored/organized : \n",
    "\n",
    "    The data would stored in tidy format, such that each column represents a variable and each row represents a track by year.\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    track_index, track_name, artist, genre, year, period, popularity, tempo, danceability, loudness, energy\n",
    "    This structure makes it easy to compare pre and post covid, and also allows for regretion and correlation analysis\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Potential Datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "    This kind of dataset probably does not exist, so we would use a combination of the following datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Spotify Web API and Kaggle Spotify Data Set :\n",
    "    Free developer access and API authentication is required for this dataset\n",
    "    This dataset includes the following variables: tempo, energy, valence, danceability, track popularity score, artist genre, release dates. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Why is supports our project: \n",
    "    Provides quality audio characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "    Some limitations include:\n",
    "    Only inclduing data within spotify, and no chart rankings\n",
    "\n",
    "    Kaggle's Version of the Spotify dataset does include time variable features but they dont look completely consistent with other data. Also presents issues because it only considers \n",
    "    music available on spotify. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Billboard Charts Data ( billboard.com/charts ) :\n",
    "\n",
    "    Accessible publicly, This dataset includes weekly chart rankings, chart dates, and track and artist names. \n",
    "    Why this supports our project: \n",
    "    Provides popularity measures beyond the Spotify API.\n",
    "    Limitations:\n",
    "    No audio characteristic Features \n",
    "\n",
    "    Since there are no \"perfect\" data sets our best option is the combination of the Spotify API, Spotify Kaggle, and Billboard Chart data, which approximates the ideal dataset\n",
